#TODO#

* finish partitioned binary relation stuff
* check that nothing is missing in semigroup-matrix-*
* add tests for all Semigroupe manual example things
* non-prime finite fields
* remove C++11
* gmp problems?
* use namespace in the C++ code
* clean up the memory usage in semigroups.h, interface.cc
* add _report for all methods that call enumerate in semigroups.h
* DClass(TransformationSemigroup, BooleanMat) sometimes seg faults or returns an answers which it shouldn't!
* reporting in semigroups.h (toggle_report and _report)
* fix the relations methods
* [ Transformation( [ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 ] ), Transformation( [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ] ),
  Transformation( [ 1, 3, 1, 5, 1 ] ), Transformation( [ 1, 1, 2, 1, 4 ] ),
  Transformation( [ 1, 1, 5, 1, 3 ] ), Transformation( [ 1, 4, 1, 2, 1 ] ) ]
  the generic semigroup generated by these generators has a weird and wrong
  D-class diagram. 
* T_PLIST_TAB instead of T_PLIST? Double-check this is ok.

#Gaplint:#

* NrLeftBlocks, NrBlocks are in gaplint_ignore since the every way to create 
  a bipartition sets these attribute just after creation. Hence if I install a
  method for these, then it will never be run, hence hurting our code coverage. 

#Code coverage:#

* bipartition.tst tests factor.gi to 80%

#General notes:#

* need to check usage of IsSemigroup and IsFinite, the max-plus matrix
  semigroup examples can finite or infinite, we should check if they are finite
  (somehow) and then use RightCayleyGraphSemigroup...
* HasGeneratorsOfMagmaIdeal has been changed to HasGeneratorsOfSemigroupIdeal
  in lots of places.

#New features in this branch:#

* IsSemigroupWithInverseOp 
* SemigroupOptions is an attribute, has a component generic which is set to
  true or false
