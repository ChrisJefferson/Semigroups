#TODO#
###There are more TODOs in the source files this list is not exhaustive###





* tests for pbrs 


* finish partitioned binary relation stuff (more tests and C++)
* check that nothing is missing in semigroup-matrix-*
* add tests for all Semigroupe manual example things

* split the "closure" constructor for a semigroup into 2 methods
* replace `ClosureSemigroup` by `SEMIGROUPS_AddGenerators` where appropriate
* closure of generic inverse semigroups
* improve `EvaluateWord`
* remove RecVecs
* check for memleaks
* remove C++11?
* gmp problems?
* use namespace in the C++ code
* `T_PLIST_TAB` instead of `T_PLIST`? Double-check this is ok, and then implement if it is.
* a new GAP kernel version of the C++ code !
* new ideals stuff!

#DONE
* semigroups of pbrs (`ViewString`, `IsPBRSemigroup`, etc)
* `[ Transformation( [ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 ] ), Transformation( [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ] ),
  Transformation( [ 1, 3, 1, 5, 1 ] ), Transformation( [ 1, 1, 2, 1, 4 ] ),
  Transformation( [ 1, 1, 5, 1, 3 ] ), Transformation( [ 1, 4, 1, 2, 1 ] ) ]`
  the generic semigroup generated by these generators has a weird and wrong
  D-class diagram. 
* `DClass(TransformationSemigroup, BooleanMat)` sometimes seg faults or returns an answers which it shouldn't!
* faster idempotent c++ code (trace and check idempotent at the same time)
* `SEMIGROUPS_AddGenerators` will only work for collection of generators of same degree.
* closure semigroup GAP kernel version (just use `Semigroup`)
* fix the relations methods in the cpp code.
* reporting in semigroups.h (toggle_report and _report)
* add `_report` for all methods that call `enumerate` in semigroups.h
* change of degree in closure in C++
* test `ClosureSemigroup` for more than one new generator
* `relations` method
* try to find the full PBR monoid when n = 1, 2. 
* fix `nrrules`
* `AsBipartitionSemigroup`, `AsPBRSemigroup`
* Boolean matrix stuff (`CanonicalRep` and things from semigroups-dev)
* replace `Permuted(gens, Random(SymmetricGroup...)` by `Shuffle`
* `TransposedMat` methods for matrix over semiring variants (so far only done boolean matrices and a generic method)
* make 2.6 branch with new style Green's class printing in tests.

#DO LATER
* non-prime finite fields
* a method for `SEMIGROUPS_AddGenerators` for acting semigroups?

#Gaplint - Notes#

* `NrLeftBlocks`, `NrBlocks` are in gaplint_ignore since the every way to create 
  a bipartition sets these attribute just after creation. Hence if I install a
  method for these, then it will never be run, hence hurting our code coverage. 

#Code coverage - Notes#

* bipartition.tst tests factor.gi to 80%

#General notes:#

* need to check usage of `IsSemigroup` and `IsFinite`, the max-plus matrix
  semigroup examples can finite or infinite, we should check if they are finite
  (somehow) and then use `RightCayleyGraphSemigroup`...
* `HasGeneratorsOfMagmaIdeal` has been changed to `HasGeneratorsOfSemigroupIdeal`
  in lots of places.

#New features in this branch:#

* `IsSemigroupWithInverseOp` 
* `SEMIGROUPS_OptionsRec` is an attribute, has a component generic which is set to
  true or false
