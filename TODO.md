###GAP

##DO LATER
* `Idempotents(S, 1)` for non-acting semigroups (I don't think this makes sense in general, what is the 1 for?)
* objectify bipartitions etc in c code (i.e. don't call CALL_1ARGS)
* a `small_generating_set` method using the Cayley graph
* Trahtman $$$O(|X| n ^ 2)$$$ algorithm for saying if a transformation semigroup $$$S = \langle X\rangle$$$ of degree $$$n$$$ is $$$\mathscr{J}$$$-trivial
* unify ideals-lambda-rho, lambda-rho and graded.
* improve `EvaluateWord`
* non-prime finite fields
* a method for `SEMIGROUPS_AddGenerators` for acting semigroups?

##DONE
* better enumerator method for C++ semigroups (don't transfer everything from C++ to GAP just transfer the `enum[pos]` value)
* enumerator sorted
* `ReadGenerators` and `WriteGenerators` for new types
* `HallMatrixMonoid`
* `ReflexiveBooleanMatrixMonoid`

* **Move the new view string methods into the library.**
* change `IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigroup` for generic semigroups to find a small generating set
* Print for `S := Semigroup(PartialPerm([1]), PartialPerm([]));` returns the wrong thing
* tests for pbrs
* check that nothing is missing in semigroup-matrix-*
* `ViewString` for full transformation monoid, and symmetric inverse monoid
* improve compilation time by removing unnecessary templates
* replace `ClosureSemigroup` by `SEMIGROUPS_AddGenerators` where appropriate
* ask Wilf to add a --recompile option to gap-profile (it should probably not run autoconf, and it should handle the gap root better (currently it only 
* fix the bug in the c++ code `add_generators` relating to the changeset tagged `bug-in-c-code`
* split the "closure" constructor for a semigroup into 2 methods
**BUG**:

    gap> RegularBooleanMatMonoid(1);
    <commutative monoid of 1x1 boolean matrices with 1 generator>
    gap> Size(last);
    Assertion failed: (IS_BLIST_REP(ELM_PLIST(o, 1))), function convert, file src/converter.cc, line 48.
    Abort trap: 6
    
* finish partitioned binary relation stuff (more tests and C++)
* `TrivialSemigroup` function
* semigroups of pbrs (`ViewString`, `IsPBRSemigroup`, etc)
* `[ Transformation( [ 3, 3, 3, 3, 3 ] ), Transformation( [ 4, 4, 4, 4, 4 ] ),
  Transformation( [ 1, 3, 1, 5, 1 ] ), Transformation( [ 1, 1, 2, 1, 4 ] ),
  Transformation( [ 1, 1, 5, 1, 3 ] ), Transformation( [ 1, 4, 1, 2, 1 ] ) ]`
  the generic semigroup generated by these generators has a weird and wrong
  D-class diagram. 
* `DClass(TransformationSemigroup, BooleanMat)` sometimes seg faults or returns an answers which it shouldn't!
* faster idempotent c++ code (trace and check idempotent at the same time)
* `SEMIGROUPS_AddGenerators` will only work for collection of generators of same degree.
* closure semigroup GAP kernel version (just use `Semigroup`)
* fix the relations methods in the cpp code.
* reporting in semigroups.h (toggle_report and _report)
* add `_report` for all methods that call `enumerate` in semigroups.h
* change of degree in closure in C++
* test `ClosureSemigroup` for more than one new generator
* `relations` method
* try to find the full PBR monoid when n = 1, 2. 
* fix `nrrules`
* `AsBipartitionSemigroup`, `AsPBRSemigroup`
* Boolean matrix stuff (`CanonicalRep` and things from semigroups-dev)
* replace `Permuted(gens, Random(SymmetricGroup...)` by `Shuffle`
* `TransposedMat` methods for matrix over semiring variants (so far only done boolean matrices and a generic method)
* make 2.6 branch with new style Green's class printing in tests.


#Gaplint - Notes#

* `NrLeftBlocks`, `NrBlocks` are in gaplint_ignore since the every way to create 
  a bipartition sets these attribute just after creation. Hence if I install a
  method for these, then it will never be run, hence hurting our code coverage. 

#Code coverage - Notes#

* bipartition.tst tests factor.gi to 80%

#General notes:#

* need to check usage of `IsSemigroup` and `IsFinite`, the max-plus matrix
  semigroup examples can finite or infinite, we should check if they are finite
  (somehow) and then use `RightCayleyGraphSemigroup`...
* `HasGeneratorsOfMagmaIdeal` has been changed to `HasGeneratorsOfSemigroupIdeal`
  in lots of places.
