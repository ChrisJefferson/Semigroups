  This chapter describes the functions in &Semigroups; for dealing with
  matrix semigroups. This part of the manual and the functions described
  herein were written by Markus Pfeiffer.<P/>

  A <E>matrix semigroup</E> for the purposes of this document is a subsemigroup
  of the full monoid of <M>n \times n</M> matrices over a <E>finite field</E>
  <M>\mathbb{F}</M>.

  More general matrix semigroups are planned, but not implemented yet.

  For technical reasons, the matrix semigroup functions in &Semigroups; rely
  on a custom wrapper for matrices <Ref Filt="IsSMatrixObj"/>.
  We take every precaution to hide this fact from the user of &Semigroups;.

  <Heading>Creating matrix semigroups</Heading>

  Random matrix semigroups can be created by using the functions <Ref Func="RandomMatrixSemigroup"/>
  or <Ref Func="RandomMatrixMonoid"/>. While this is convenient for testing and playing around,
  creating semigroups from matrices can be a bit more work.

  We provide a couple of convenience functions to streamline the process.
