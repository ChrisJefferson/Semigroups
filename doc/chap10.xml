  This chapter describes the functions in &Semigroups; for dealing with
  matrix semigroups. This part of the manual and the functions described
  herein were written by Markus Pfeiffer.<P/>

  A <E>matrix semigroup</E> for the purposes of this document is a subsemigroup
  of the full monoid of <M>n\times n</M> matrices over a <E>finite field</E>
  <M>\mathbb{F}</M>,.

  More general matrix semigroups are planned, but not implemented yet.

  The matrix semigroup functions in &Semigroups; rely on <Ref Filt="IsMatrixObj"/>
  objects defined in the GAP library, but take every precaution to hide
  this fact from the user of &Semigroups;.

  Ideally using &Semigroups; with matrices should go as follows:
  <Example>
gap> S := MatrixSemigroup(Z(4) * [[1,0,0], [1,1,0], [0,1,0]],
&gt;                          Z(4) * [[0,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,1,0]]);
&lt;semigroup of 3x3 matrices over GF(2^2) with 2 generators&gt;
gap>
  </Example>
  <M>S</M> is now a semigroup object for all intents and purposes of
  &Semigroups;
