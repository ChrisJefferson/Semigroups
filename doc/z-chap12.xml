    A semigroup <M>B</M> is a <E>free band</E> on a non-empty set <M>X</M> if
    <M>B</M> is a band with a map <M> f </M> from <M> B </M> to <M>X</M> such that
    for every band <M> S </M> and every map <M> g </M> from <M>X</M> to <M> B </M>
    there exists a unique homomorphism <M> g'</M> from <M>B</M> to <M>S</M> such
    that <M>fg' = g</M>. The free band on a set <M>X</M> is unique up to
    isomorphism.  Moreover, by the universal property, every band can be expressed
    as a quotient of a free band.<P/>

    For an alternative description of a free band. Suppose that <M> X </M> is a
    non-empty set and <M> X ^ + </M> a free semigroup on <M> X </M>. Also suppose
    that <M> b </M> is the smallest congurance on <M> X ^ + </M> containing the set
    <Display> \{(w ^ 2, w) : w \in X ^ + \}. </Display> Then the free band on
    <M> X </M> is isomorphic to the quotient of <M> X ^ + </M> by <M> b </M>.
    See Section 4.5 of <Cite Key = "Howie1995aa" /> for more information on
    free bands.
