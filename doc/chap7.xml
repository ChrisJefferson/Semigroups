<Chapter Label="Congruences on completely 0-simple semigroups">
  <Heading>Congruences on completely 0-simple semigroups</Heading> This chapter
  describes the implementation of congruences on completely 0-simple semigroups
  in the &Semigroups; package, and the functions associated with them.  This
  code and this part of the manual were written by Michael Torpey.  Most of the
  theorems used in this chapter are from Section 3.5 of <Cite Key =
  "howie"/>.<P/>

  By the Rees Theorem, any 0-simple semigroup <M>S</M> is isomorphic to a
  <E>Rees 0-matrix semigroup</E> (see <Ref Chap = "Rees Matrix Semigroups"
  BookName = "ref" />) over a group, with a regular sandwich matrix.

    That is, <Display>S \cong \mathcal{M}^0[G; I,\Lambda; P], </Display> where
    <M>G</M> is a group, <M>\Lambda</M> and <M>I</M> are non-empty sets, and
    <M>P</M> is regular in the sense that no two of its rows or columns contain
    only zeroes.

    That is, S is isomorphic to M^0[G; I,L; P] where G is a group, L and I are
    non-empty sets and the matrix P is regular in the sense that no two of its
    rows or columns contain only zeroes.

  By Theorem 3.5.9, there is a bijection between the set of congruences of such
  a semigroup, and the set of <E>linked triples</E>.  A linked triple of such a
  semigroup is a triple of the form
  <Alt Not="Text"><M>(N,\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})</M></Alt>
  <Alt Only="Text">(N,S,T)</Alt>
