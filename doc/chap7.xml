  <Heading>Congruences on completely 0-simple semigroups</Heading>

  This chapter describes the implementation of congruences on completely
  0-simple semigroups in the &Semigroups; package, and the functions associated
  with them.  This code and this part of the manual were written by Michael
  Torpey.  Most of the theorems used in this chapter are from Section 3.5 of
  <Cite Key = "howie"/>.<P/>

  By the Rees Theorem, any 0-simple semigroup <M>S</M> is isomorphic to a
  <E>Rees 0-matrix semigroup</E> (see <Ref Chap = "Rees Matrix Semigroups"
  BookName = "ref" />) over a group, with a regular sandwich matrix.

    <M>G</M> is a group, <M>\Lambda</M> and <M>I</M> are non-empty sets, and
    <M>P</M> is regular in the sense that no two of its rows or columns contain
    only zeroes.

    By Theorem 3.5.9, there is a bijection between the set of non-universal
    congruences of a finite 0-simple Rees 0-matrix semigroup, and the set of its
    linked triples.  In this way, we can internally represent any congruence of
    such a semigroup by storing its associated linked triple instead of a set of
    generating pairs, and thus perform many calculations on it more
    efficiently.<P/>

    If a congruence is defined by a linked triple
    <Alt Not="Text"><M>(N,\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})</M></Alt>
    <Alt Only="Text">(N,S,T)</Alt> 
    then a single class of that congruence can be defined by a triple
    <Alt Not="Text"><M>(Nx,i/\mathcal{S},\lambda/\mathcal{T})</M>,</Alt>
    <Alt Only="Text">(Nx,i/S,u/T),</Alt>
    where <M>Nx</M> is a right coset of <M>N</M>,
    <M>i/<Alt Not="Text">\mathcal</Alt>{S}</M> is an equivalence class of
    columns under <M><Alt Not="Text">\mathcal</Alt>{S}</M>, and
    <M><Alt Not="Text">\lambda / \mathcal</Alt><Alt Only="Text">u/</Alt>{T}</M>
    is an equivalence class of rows under <M><Alt Not="Text">\mathcal</Alt>{T}</M>.
    Thus we can internally represent any class of such a congruence as a triple
    simply consisting of a right coset and two positive integers.<P/>

    <Heading>Universal Semigroup Congruences</Heading>

    The linked triples of a completely 0-simple Rees 0-matrix semigroup describe
    only its non-universal congruences.  In any one of these, the zero element
    of the semigroup is related only to itself.  However, for any semigroup
    <M>S</M> there must exist the universal congruence <M>S<Alt
    Not="Text"> \times </Alt><Alt Only="Text">x</Alt>S</M>.  We must therefore
    represent this in a different way from the other congruences.<P/>

    Since many things we want to calculate about congruences are trivial in the
    case of the universal congruence, this package contains a category
    specifically designed for it, <C>IsUniversalSemigroupCongruence</C>.  This
    allows for universal semigroup congruences to be described together with the
    linked triples, to be compared and used together in functions.  We also
    define <C>IsUniversalSemigroupCongruenceClass</C>, which acts as the single
    congruence class of the universal congruence.<P/>
