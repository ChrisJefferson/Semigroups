    <Func Name="ClosureSemigroup" Arg="S, coll"/> 
    <Returns>a transformation semigroup or monoid.</Returns> 
    <Description> 
      this function returns the semigroup or monoid generated by the 
      transformation semigroup <A>S</A> and the transformation collection or 
      transformation  <A>coll</A> after removing duplicates and 
      transformations in <A>coll</A> that 
      are already in <A>S</A>.   The new semigroup contains at least as
      much information about its structure as was already known about that of
      <A>S</A>. <P/>
      
      More specifically, the new semigroup knows the Green's class of
      any representative of a Green's classes of <A>S</A> that is 
      known at the time that 
      <C>ClosureSemigroup</C> is called. Consequently, if, for example, 
      the number of &R;-classes of <A>S</A> is greater than the number of
      elements required to find the &R;-classes of the new semigroup, then    
      <C>ClosureSemigroup</C> might be less efficient than creating the
      new semigroup using the command
      <Ref Oper="Semigroup" BookName="ref"/> or 
      <Ref Oper="Monoid" BookName="ref"/>. It is unlikely that you will be able
      to determine which of  <C>ClosureSemigroup</C> and
      <Ref Oper="Semigroup" BookName="ref"/> will be better, before calling
      these functions except in the following case. If the rank of the
      transformations in <A>coll</A> are lower than the ranks of the Green's
      classes containing the majority of the known elements of <A>S</A>, then
      <C>ClosureSemigroup</C> should be superior to 
      <Ref Oper="Semigroup" BookName="ref"/>.

      See also <Ref Prop="IsTransformationCollection" BookName="ref"/>. <P/>
