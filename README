Getting Semigroups
------------------

To get the latest version of this GAP 4.5 package download the archive file 

    semigroups-x.x.tar.gz

from 

    http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups.php

and inside the 'pkg' subdirectory of your GAP 4 installation unpack
semigroups-x.x.tar.gz using:

    gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar

This will create a subdirectory 'semigroups-x.x'.

Installation
------------

It is assumed that you have a working copy of GAP with version number 4.5 or
higher.  The  most  up-to-date  version  of  GAP  and instructions on how to
install it can be obtained from the main GAP webpage
  
  http://www.gap-system.org
  
The  following  is  a  summary of the steps that should lead to a successful
installation of Semigroups:

 *   download  and  install the Orb package version 4.2 or higher. For more
     details go to:

  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html

     Note that Orb and Semigroups both perform better if Orb is compiled.

 *   download  and  install the genss package version 1.5 or higher. For more
     details go to:

  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/genss.html

 *   download and install the IO package version 4.1 or higher. For more
     details go to:

  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html

 *   if you want to be able to calculate the Munn semigroup of a semilattice,
     then download and fully install (i.e. compile it) the Grape package
     version 4.5 or higher.  For more details go to:

     http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/

     This step is optional: please consult the section 'The Grape package'
     below for more details. 

 *   download the package archive semigroups-x.x.tar.gz from

     http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/citrus.php

 *   unzip  and  untar  the file semigroups-x.x.tar.gz using
 
        gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar
    
     this  should  create a directory called semigroups-x.x.

 *   locate  the  'pkg'  directory  of your GAP directory, which contains the
     directories lib, doc and so on. Move the directory semigroups-x.x into the
     pkg directory (if it is not there already).

 *   start GAP in the usual way.

 *   type LoadPackage("semigroups");

 *   compile the documentation by typing 
 
        SemigroupsMakeDoc();

The Grape Package
-----------------

The Grape package is required for the function MunnSemigroup to work and so
Grape is a suggested package for Semigroups. If Grape is not fully installed,
then Semigroups can be used as normal with the exception that the function
MunnSemigroup does not work. 

Further Information
-------------------

Please email me if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions, or find any
issues. Also I would like to hear about any applications of this package
(jdm3@st-and.ac.uk).
