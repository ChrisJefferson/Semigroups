This is the README file of the Citrus package version 0.1 for computing with 
transformation semigroups. Citrus 0.1 is an updated version of the Monoid 
package for GAP 3 and 4; see

http://schmidt.nuigalway.ie/monoid/index.html

for more information about the original Monoid package by Goetz 
Pfeiffer and Steve A. Linton, Edmund F. Robertson and Nik Ruskuc, or

http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/monoid/index.html

for more information about Monoid 3.1.4 for GAP 4. 

The functionality of Monoid 3.1.4 has been split across two GAP 4.5 packages
Citrus and Comatose (for ease of maintanence and development). 

Citrus 0.1 retains all the functionality of the original Monoid package for
GAP 3; and those functions from Monoid 3.1.4 not involved in the computation of
automorphism groups of semigroups. The Comatose Package retains those
functions from Monoid 3.1.4 used to compute 
automorphism groups of transformation semigroups. See 

http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/comatose/index.html

Citrus 0.1 contains more efficient methods than those available in the GAP 
library for calculating Green's classes, finding the size, the elements, and 
testing membership in transformation semigroups. After Citrus has been loaded 
many of these methods are automatically used in preference to those in the 
library and do not need to be called explicitly by the user.

In addition, there are methods for testing if a semigroup satisfies a 
particular property, such as if it is regular, simple, inverse, or completely 
regular. 

The Citrus package is written in GAP code only but requires the `orb' package.
`orb' is used to provide efficient methods for computing orbits in 
transformation semigroups that underpin most of the features of Citrus. See:

http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html

or the main GAP webpages for more information. 

Getting Citrus
--------------

You can download the package from:

http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/Citrus/index.html 

in .tar.gz, and .tar.bz2 formats.

Contents
--------

The Citrus folder containing this README.txt file should contain the 
directories and files: `doc', `examples', `gap', `init.g', `PackageInfo.g',
`read.g', `README.txt', `tmp', and `tst'. JDM correct?

Installation
------------

1) unpack the file (for example, by using `gunzip Citrus3r1p4.tar.gz' and 
then `tar -xf Citrus0r1.tar' in UNIX).

2) move the resultant directory `Citrus' into the `pkg' directory of your 
GAP directory (the directory containing the directories `lib', `doc', 
`pkg', and so on).

3) start GAP in the usual way.

4) type `LoadPackage("Citrus");'. 

Example Installation
--------------------

unix> gunzip Citrus0r1.tar.gz 
unix> tar -xf Citrus0r1.tar 
unix> mv Citrus GAPROOT/pkg
unix> gap

[ ... ]

gap> LoadPackage("Citrus");

Presuming that the above steps can be completed successfully you will be 
running the Citrus package!

Further Information
-------------------

For details on how to use the Citrus package see the package documentation 
(prepared using the GAPDOC package) in the `doc' subdirectory (view either 
the html file `chap0.html' via a webbrowser or the file `manual.pdf' via a
PDF viewer).

If you use the Citrus package, I'd be interested to know about it
(jdm3@st-and.ac.uk).
