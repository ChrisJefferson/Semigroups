Getting Semigroups
--------------

To get the latest version of this GAP 4.5 package download the archive file 

    semigroups-x.x.tar.gz

from 

    http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups/index.html 

and inside the 'pkg' subdirectory of your GAP 4 installation unpack
semigroups-x.x.tar.gz using:

    gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar

This will create a subdirectory 'semigroups-x.x'.

Installation
------------

It is assumed that you have a working copy of GAP with version number 4.5 or
higher.  The  most  up-to-date  version  of  GAP  and instructions on how to
install it can be obtained from the main GAP webpage
  
  http://www.gap-system.org
  
The  following  is  a  summary of the steps that should lead to a successful
installation of Semigroups:

 *   download  and  install the Orb package version 4.2 or higher. For more
     details go to:

  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/orb.html

     Note that Orb and Semigroups both perform better if Orb is compiled.

 *   download and install the IO package version 4.1 or higher. For more
     details go to:

  http://www-groups.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~neunhoef/Computer/Software/Gap/io.html

 *   if you want to be able to calculate the Munn semigroup of a semilattice,
     then download and fully install (i.e. compile it) the Grape package
     version 4.5 or higher.  For more details go to:

     http://www.maths.qmul.ac.uk/~leonard/grape/

     This step is optional: please consult the section 'The Grape package'
     below for more details. 

 *   download the package archive semigroups-x.x.tar.gz from

     http://www-history.mcs.st-and.ac.uk/~jamesm/semigroups/index.html

 *   unzip  and  untar  the file semigroups-x.x.tar.gz using
 
        gunzip semigroups-x.x.tar.gz; tar xvf semigroups-x.x.tar
    
     this  should  create a directory called semigroups-x.x.

 *   locate  the  'pkg'  directory  of your GAP directory, which contains the
     directories lib, doc and so on. Move the directory semigroups-x.x into the
     pkg directory (if it is not there already).

 *   compile the GAP kernel component of Semigroups by doing (in the 'pkg'
     directory):
      
        cd semigroups-x.x 
        ./configure
        make
     
     This step is optional: please consult 'Compiling the kernel component'
     below for more detailed information.
 
 *   start GAP in the usual way.

 *   type LoadPackage("semigroups");

 *   compile the documentation by typing 
 
        SemigroupsMakeDoc();

Compiling the kernel component
------------------------------

As of version 0.7, the Semigroups package has a GAP kernel component in C which
should be compiled. This component contains low-level functions relating to
partial permutations and it is not possible to use these features or any
related features in Semigroups without compiling the package. It is possible to run
Semigroups without compiling it, but Semigroups is limited to computing with
transformation semigroups in this case. 

To compile the GAP kernel component in the 'pkg' directory do:

    cd semigroups-x.x
    ./configure
    make

If you installed the package in another 'pkg' directory than the standard 'pkg'
directory in your GAP4 installation, then you have to do two things. Firstly
during compilation you have to use the option '--with-gaproot=PATH' of the
'configure' script where 'PATH' is a path to the main GAP root directory (if
not given the default '../..' is assumed).

If you installed GAP on several architectures, you must execute the
configure/make step for each of the architectures. You can either do this
immediately after configuring and compiling GAP itself on this architecture, or
alternatively (when using version 4.5 of GAP or newer) set the environment
variable 'CONFIGNAME' to the name of the configuration you used when compiling
GAP before running './configure'.  Note however that your compiler choice and
flags (environment variables 'CC' and 'CFLAGS') need to be chosen to match the
setup of the original GAP compilation. For example you have to specify 32-bit
or 64-bit mode correctly!

The Grape Package
-----------------

The Grape package is required for the function MunnSemigroup to work and so
Grape is a suggested package for Semigroups. If Grape is not fully installed,
then Semigroups can be used as normal with the exception that the function
MunnSemigroup does not work. 

Further Information
-------------------

Please email me if you have any questions, remarks, suggestions, or find any
issues. Also I would like to hear about any applications of this package
(jdm3@st-and.ac.uk).
