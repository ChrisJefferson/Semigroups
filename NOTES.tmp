Gaplint:

* NrLeftBlocks, NrBlocks are in gaplint_ignore since the every way to create 
  a bipartition sets these attribute just after creation. Hence if I install a
  method for these, then it will never be run, hence hurting our code coverage. 

Code coverage:

* bipartition.tst tests factor.gi to 80%

General notes:

* HasGeneratorsOfMagmaIdeal has been changed to HasGeneratorsOfSemigroupIdeal
  in lots of places.

New features in this branch:

* IsInverseOpSemigroup 
* SemigroupOptions is an attribute, has a component generic which is set to
  true or false
