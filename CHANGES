# CHANGES since the release of version 3.1 of MONOID

-from 3.1.3 to 3.1.4

-- semigroups.gi:

---- improved method for RandomReesMatrixSemigroup using small groups rather than randomly 
chosen permutations.

###############

-from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3: 

--- the method for PreImagesRepresentative for a semigroup homomorphism by function now tests whether the homomorphism is bijective and total before trying to find preimages.  

###############

-from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2: the following new functions have been introduced:

--- TransformationActionNC
--- SmallestIdempotentPower 
--- IsKerImgOfTransformation
--- TransformationByKernelAndImage
--- AllTransformationsWithKerAndImgNC
--- AsBooleanMatrix
--- KerImgOfTransformation
--- RandomIdempotent
--- InversesOfTransformation
--- KiselmanSemigroup

the following functions were renamed:

--- PermRepTrans was renamed AsPermOfRange 
--- ImagesTransformationMonoid was renamed ImagesOfTransSemigroup
--- GradedImagesTransformationMonoid was renamed GradedImagesOfTransSemigroup
--- KernelsTransformationMonoid was renamed KernelsOfTransSemigroup
--- GradedKernelsTransformationMonoid was renamed GradedKernelsOfTransSemigroup

the following bugs were fixed:

--- a bug relating to the definition of the semigroup of order preserving functions was resolved

###############

- from 3.1 to 3.1.1: fixed a bug that produced an error when loading MONOID with the GRAPE package present but not fully installed.
