0.4 -> 0.5

            major changes are: the documentation has been further revised,
            functions for creating semigroups and monoids with certain
            options have been introduced, several functions have had the word
            `Greens' removed from their names to reduce the length, the
            operation ClosureSemigroup has been introduced, the functions
            ReadCitrus and WriteCitrus for reading and writing transformations
            to a file have been introduced, several catalogues of examples of
            transformation semigroups are now included in the examples
            directory, methods for creating a Green's class inside another
            Green's class have been included (such as an R-class of a D-class
            or an H-class of an L-class), the hash functions used for
            transformations etc have been improved, and methods for the
            following operations are introduced:

            AntiIsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a trans. semigroup),
            IdempotentGeneratedSubsemigp, IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup
            (for a perm. gp), IsomorphismTransformationMonoid (for a perm. gp),
            NrElementsOfRank.

0.3 -> 0.4

            major changes are: the documentation has been updated, some changes
            to core functions for R-classes/image orbits have resulted in a 
            performance improvement, there is a method for the operation
            Factorization allowing an arbitrary element of a transformation
            semigroup to be expressed as a product of the generators. 
            
            Some minor bugs have been fixed, and new methods or functions with
            the following names have also been introduced:
            
            OrbSCC, OrbSCCLookup, OrbSCCTruthTable, 
            ReverseSchreierTreeOfSCC, SchreierTreeOfSCC,
            IsomorphismTransformationSemigroup (for a perm. gp). 

0.2 -> 0.3 
            
            fixed a critical (but rare) bug in AddToOrbitsOfKernels that caused
            computations relating to D-classes, H-classes, or L-classes to
            return incorrect answers in some cases. 

0.1 -> 0.2  
            updated the method for \^ for a transformation and perm so that it
            is more efficient than the library method, same for \* for a perm 
            and transformation. New method for StructureDescription of a
            Brandt semigroup, and IsSubset for a trans. semigroup and trans.
            coll. 
    
            fixed bugs in IndexPeriodOfTransformation (it returned incorrect
            results) and AsPermutation. Also reduce hash table lengths so that 
            Citrus uses less memory. Fixed bug that triggered an infinite
            loop when trying to find elements of a trivial trans. semigroup.  

            added the functions CitrusDefaultMem, CitrusHiMem, CitrusLoMem,
            CitrusVeryLoMem, IsBrandtSemigroup, IsLeftSimple,
            IsMonogenicSemigroup, IsRightSimple, IsZeroRectangularBand,
            IsZeroSimpleSemigroup.
