# CHANGES since the release of version 3.1 of MONOID.

# see also the file RENAMED for a list of functions that have been removed or 
# renamed in the latest release. 

-from 3.1.3 to 3.1.4

	MonoidOrbit, GradedOrbits, and so on now accept a transformation collection
	as a first argument. 
	
	If the `orb' package is available, then hash tables are used instead of 
	plain lists when computing orbits. This dramatically increases the efficiency
	of these computations.
	
	the function StrongOrbitsInForwardOrbit was introduced.
	
	an improved method for RandomReesMatrixSemigroup has been installed so that 
	if the third argument is a positive integer a randomly selected small group
	of that size is used to create the semigroup. 
		
	several other minor bugs have been fixed. 
	
Renamed in 3.1.4:

	InfoAutos -> InfoMonoidAutos
	
Removed from 3.1.4:

	GradedStrongOrbits - any two elements in a StrongOrbit have equal grading and 
	hence there is no need for this function!
	
###############

-from 3.1.2 to 3.1.3: 

	the method for PreImagesRepresentative for a semigroup homomorphism by function now tests 
	whether the homomorphism is bijective and total before trying to find preimages.  

###############

-from 3.1.1 to 3.1.2: the following new functions have been introduced:

	TransformationActionNC
	SmallestIdempotentPower 
	IsKerImgOfTransformation
	TransformationByKernelAndImage
	AllTransformationsWithKerAndImgNC
	AsBooleanMatrix
	KerImgOfTransformation
	RandomIdempotent
	InversesOfTransformation
	KiselmanSemigroup

the following functions were renamed:

	PermRepTrans was renamed AsPermOfRange 
	ImagesTransformationMonoid was renamed ImagesOfTransSemigroup
	GradedImagesTransformationMonoid was renamed GradedImagesOfTransSemigroup
	KernelsTransformationMonoid was renamed KernelsOfTransSemigroup
	GradedKernelsTransformationMonoid was renamed GradedKernelsOfTransSemigroup

the following bugs were fixed:

	a bug relating to the definition of the semigroup of order preserving functions was
	resolved

###############

- from 3.1 to 3.1.1: fixed a bug that produced an error when loading MONOID with the GRAPE package present but not fully installed.
